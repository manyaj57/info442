Problem Statement


Clothing given to thrift stores is constantly being thrown away. This is a huge problem that is actively affecting thrift stores, consumers, and those overseas where unsold textiles are sent. In fact, only about 20 percent of clothing that goes to consignment shops and thrift stores is sold to consumers in the United States (The Gentrification, 2021). In 2014, 11 percent of Goodwill donations were seen as unfit for sale and ended up in landfills (Rosenberg, 2019). A small percentage of unsold clothing is shipped overseas; putting local textile workers out of work (Larnard, 2020). Oftentimes, the quality of the clothes is too poor for anyone to wear, so fields of secondhand clothes are set on fire (Larnard, 2020). Not only does this release more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, but it destroys land and vegetation in these countries. The imbalance of supply and demand of second-hand clothing can widely be attributed to the sheer time and effort it takes buyers to find thrifted goods. Many resort to buying fast fashion at similar price points with just a quick google search. While many reselling platforms and online thrift stores exist such as Poshmark, Depop, Thred up. These platforms fail to solve the problem of an excess supply of clothing already present  in physical thrift stores. Furthermore, these solutions which allow you to resell thrifted pieces are contributing to the gentrification of thrifting. Meaning resellers are cherry picking garments buying them and selling them for profit. This counters the whole purpose of thrift stores to make clothing more affordable by buying second-hand. We must work towards a solution inorder to tackle the disconnect between thrift stores and consumers.
